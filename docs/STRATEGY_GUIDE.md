## Introduction to MEV

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) represents the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fees by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions in a block. On Solana, MEV opportunities arise from the ability to observe pending transactions and strategically position trades to capture value from price movements.

### MEV Categories

**Arbitrage**: Exploiting price differences across different markets or exchanges. This is the most common and generally considered the most beneficial form of MEV as it helps maintain price consistency across markets.

**Liquidations**: Identifying and executing liquidations of undercollateralized positions in lending protocols. This helps maintain the health of DeFi protocols by ensuring bad debt is minimized.

**Sandwich Attacks**: Placing trades before and after a target transaction to profit from the price impact. This is more controversial as it can be seen as extracting value directly from users.

**Front-running**: Observing pending transactions and placing similar trades with higher fees to execute first. This is generally considered harmful to users and market efficiency.

## Sandwich Attack Fundamentals

### Mechanism Overview

A sandwich attack consists of three sequential transactions that must be executed atomically:

1. **Frontrun Transaction**: A trade placed immediately before the victim's transaction, moving the price in the same direction as the victim's trade
2. **Victim Transaction**: The original user transaction that creates the price impact
3. **Backrun Transaction**: A reverse trade that captures profit from the price movement caused by the victim's transaction

### Mathematical Foundation

The profitability of a sandwich attack depends on several key factors:

**Price Impact Function**: For most AMMs, the price impact follows a function related to the ratio of trade size to available liquidity:
```
Price Impact = f(Trade Size / Liquidity Depth)
```

**Profit Calculation**: The gross profit from a sandwich attack can be approximated as:
```
Gross Profit = (Frontrun Amount Ã— Price Impact) - (Backrun Slippage + Gas Costs)
```

**Optimal Sizing**: The optimal frontrun size maximizes the profit function while considering:
- Available capital or flashloan limits
- Gas costs for execution
- Risk of the victim transaction failing
- Competition from other MEV bots

### Execution Requirements

**Atomicity**: All three transactions must execute in the correct order within the same block. On Solana, this is achieved through Jito bundles or careful timing with high priority fees.

**Speed**: MEV is highly competitive, requiring sub-second detection and execution times. The bot must monitor mempool activity and react faster than competitors.

**Capital Efficiency**: Using flashloans allows for larger position sizes without requiring significant upfront capital, increasing potential profits while managing risk.

## Solana MEV Landscape

### Unique Characteristics

**High Throughput**: Solana's high transaction throughput (3,000+ TPS) creates more MEV opportunities but also increases competition.

**Low Fees**: Lower transaction costs make smaller MEV opportunities economically viable compared to Ethereum.

**Parallel Processing**: Solana's parallel transaction processing can affect MEV strategies, as transactions touching different accounts can execute simultaneously.

**Leader Schedule**: Solana's deterministic leader schedule allows for some predictability in block production, which can be leveraged for MEV strategies.

### Jito Integration

Jito provides crucial infrastructure for MEV on Solana:

**Bundle Submission**: Allows submission of multiple transactions that must execute atomically in the specified order.

**MEV Protection**: Provides protection against other MEV bots by ensuring transaction ordering within bundles.

**Validator Incentives**: Allows tipping validators to prioritize bundle inclusion, improving execution probability.

### DEX Landscape

**Raydium**: The largest DEX on Solana, offering both AMM and concentrated liquidity pools. High volume makes it a prime target for MEV extraction.

**Orca**: Features innovative concentrated liquidity (Whirlpools) and traditional AMM pools. Lower fees and different pool structures create unique opportunities.

**Phoenix**: Order book-based DEX providing different MEV opportunities through limit order interactions and market making.

## Strategy Implementation

### Opportunity Detection

**Transaction Monitoring**: The bot continuously monitors pending transactions across multiple RPC endpoints and WebSocket connections to detect high-value opportunities.

**Filtering Criteria**:
